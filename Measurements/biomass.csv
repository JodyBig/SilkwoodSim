24/03/2015,0,stalk_elongation,2,52.6,25.9,78.5,52,61,113,,,"I have attached our results for 2014-16, also please have a read of the notes on biomass sampling and calculations,"
24/03/2015,0,stalk_elongation,3,48.2,21.8,69.9,43,45,88,,,this will hopefully give you a better idea of the sampling scheme and calculations we have used. 
24/03/2015,0,stalk_elongation,4,52.1,26.8,78.9,46,57,103,,,"I can say that our biomass estimates are likely to be an overestimate of actual biomass, difficult to say by how much but maybe ~5%. "
